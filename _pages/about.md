Welcome to Wei Fan (范玮) `s Homepage!

I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science of University of Central Florida supervised by [Dr. Yanjie Fu](https://www.yanjiefu.com/). I recieved my B.E. degree of Computer Science and Technology from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2020. My research interests mainly include data mining and machine learning.

Luckily, I have onced worked as a research intern in machine learning area, Microsoft Research Asia, where I met with my mentor [Dr. Shun Zheng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shunzhen/) and [Dr. Jiang Bian](https://sites.google.com/view/jiangbian) who gave me valuable guidance. I was a research intern at Baidu Research, supervised by [Dr. Hui Xiong](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/). I also worked a research intern at Baidu Research supervised by [Dr. Hao Liu](https://raymondhliu.github.io/). Before that, I have been an algorithm intern at speech team of [Bytedance AI Lab](https://bytedance.com/). Besides, I have once worked as a undergraduate research assisitant with [Dr. Tianyu Liu](https://tyliupku.github.io/) and [Dr. Wenfei Wu](https://wenfei-wu.github.io/).
